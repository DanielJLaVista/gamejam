# Initial Game Ideas

As a first start, I think making a a fun goofy cooperative 4 player game that we would all enjoy playing would be good to work on together, or a simple single player game.

| Skyroads / F-Zero                 | Single Player   | "Dodge em'" kind of game where you are dodging incoming projectiles and maneuvering yourself to the end of a "race" level. <br><br>F-zero is like this but more mario-karty racing other people on a track. <br><br>![[Pasted image 20251128191620.png\|300]]![[Pasted image 20251128191635.png\|300]]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| FTL COOP                          | 2-4 Player COOP | FTL rip off that is multi-player. Controlling independent ships to explore a solar system / story, and battling pirates  and aliens together.<br><br>Would have room for some interesting story-development as well as I thought that was always lacking with FTL. <br><br>Lots of interesting ship systems we could implement that work well with multi-player e.g. some people focusing their ships on guns, others on cyber attacks, others on boarding enemy vessels.  <br><br><br>![[Pasted image 20251128190135.png\|300]]<br><br>Other games like it: <br><br>Voidwar<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG__JWcpymc |
| Slice of Life Alien Parasite Game | 2-4 Player COOP | A game where you are a hivemind creature that is attempting to infest planet Earth, but to do so you must learn how to be human. 4 of you control a single human as he goes about daily life in an office, trying to blend in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Wizard based PvP | 2-16 Player PVP        | Chivalry / Mage Arena like game without the voice commands, but fighting other wizards in a pvp arena.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Siege warfare    | 2-16 Player PVP or PVE | Would love a game that show-cased siege warfare properly. Could be a Chivalry first-person PVP game, or a more strategic RTS game.<br><br>Setting up your castles for defending and deploying siege equipment<br>- Build your castle fortifications<br>- Add murder holes into walls<br>- Construct self-sufficient towers<br>- Add Chains to stop calvary charges<br><br>Could be effectively a tower defence game, but its more about creating your castle and defending your castle instead of setting up a city/village. |

# General Concepts

Some cool concepts that I think would work as mechanics during a boss fight, or moment in the game. 

| Concept   | Games this would work | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Puppeteer | Platformers           | Temporarily controlling your character through a puppeteer control mechanic, with up/down controlling your legs/arms would be very cool as a boss fight. And the boss being able to "snip" your strings to reduce your manoeuvrability. |
